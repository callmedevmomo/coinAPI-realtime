# Coin Track!

## Challenge:

- Using the awesome Coinpaprika API build a "real-time" crypto price tracker dashboard!
- There is one URL https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers that gives you all the coins with their price in USD

### Call the URL when the page loads

- Show me a loading indicator when the request is happening When the data comes, paint all the coins with their prices. Every 5 seconds call the URL again and repaint the  results


#### Notes

- Because the API is now on https you can work on Codesandbox for this one.
